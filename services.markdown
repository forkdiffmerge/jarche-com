[![ita_logo][5]][6]Major projects are usually conducted in collaboration with 
one or more of my colleagues (Jay Cross, Jane Hart, Charles Jennings, Clark 
Quinn) at the **[Internet Time Alliance][7]**, ([not your average consultancy][8]) 
a multidisciplinary, international think tank. The Internet Time Alliance is 
focused on integrating learning into the workflow and helps organizations work 
smarter by being more social, collaborative and open.

For example:

**[AstraZeneca][9] **- Collaboration and knowledge-sharing framework for the 
research & development division of this pharmaceutical company.

**[CIGNA][10]** - Informal learning and working smarter strategy for CIGNA 
University to support this health services company.

**[Canadian International Development Agency][11]** – Informal learning strategy 
and action plan for the Continuous Learning Division of this government agency. 

[][12]**PUBLIC SPEAKING**

I speak on topics related to the intersection of learning, work and technology; 
which has been my area of professional passion for the past decade. Contact 
me to develop a custom engagement that is leading-edge but always pragmatic. 

Some participant comments from a 2012 engagement:

> 
> I really like Harold and his views. More time and possibly a workshop next year.  
>  Great presentation. To the point, and relevant. Harold kept the audience engaged and left time to answer questions.  
>  Harold Jarche is very informative and provides practical tips for being connected!  
>  Great content. Plenty of ideas to take back to the workplace for inclusion in practice.

# COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE

Working smarter in an increasingly complex business environment requires the 
integration of learning into the workflow. Whether online communities are designed 
more for networked learning or collaborative work, there are three major components 
to address:

1. 
**Business or Operational Model**: how the initiative fits into the organization’s ecosystem.
2. 
**Social Architecture**: how collaboration is facilitated and what aspects should supported, such as performance support; communities of practice; knowledge management, informal learning or distributed work teams.
3. 
**Technology Platform**: identifying and implementing technologies that are best-suited for the organization’s business and collaboration objectives and how they can be integrated within existing constraints.

Consulting services can include business plan development, high-level architecture, 
statements of work, technical specifications, vendor evaluations, and support 
for community managers**.**

# PERFORMANCE CONSULTING

Performance Consulting & Strategic Alignment is a consulting service that provides 
a systemic and systematic approach to align the human performance systems within 
your organization. The service includes: performance analysis, mapping of the 
major systems and processes, and the structure for the basis of a business 
plan. This can be focused on the entire organization or a specific department.
