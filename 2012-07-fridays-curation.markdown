# Friday’s curation

Posted on [Friday, 27 July 2012][2] by [Harold Jarche][3]		

**Here are some of the observations and insights that were shared [via Twitter][4] this 
past week. **

@mikeridell62 – “_Just as the industrial age ended slave labour the information 
age is likely to end mass-wage labour._”

@tom_peters – “_Winners: Thrive on chaos-ambiguity. Sense of humor. Live by: 
Try-something-right-now. Celebrate failures. Resilience. Relationships nut_.” 

@jhagel – [**Finite Games as Probes in complexity**][5] – via @timekord

> As I noted above, Carse insightfully points out that boundaries are necessary 
> for finite games while infinite game players seek to undermine all boundaries.  
> Given my preoccupation with the importance of edges, this might appear to be 
> a contradiction.  To be clear, **I am drawn to edges (what Carse labels as 
> horizons) precisely because they generate possibility, not because they define 
> limits.  Edges are fertile ground for an infinite game that draws out potential 
> and possibility in part because finite game players tend to avoid them and 
> they attract those who are more excited by infinite games.**

@crumphelen - ”[**an experiment to narrate my work/learning for one day**][6]” 
[good example of [PKM][7]]

[**Tame, Wicked and Critical Problems**][8]: An introduction to the Cuckoo 
Clock Syndrome – via @commutiny

> 
> Elegant solutions do not work for Wicked problems because they sit across various 
> difficult cultures and institutions. Not everyone responds well to punitive 
> hierarchical measures. Nor is everyone affected equally by the incentives and 
> support offered by individualists. Rather, what is required when approaching 
> Wicked problems are ‘Clumsy’ solutions; those that broach and draw upon different 
> cultural understandings. Here, Grint emphasises the importance of implementing 
> ‘experimental’ approaches “because we cannot know whether the approach we adopt 
> will eventually work; if we did it would be a Tame or Critical problem.” The 
> key is for policymakers and leaders to act as ‘bricoleurs’ and ‘experimental 
> pragmatists’, eschewing nicely framed Elegant responses which are the preserve 
> of many policymakers.

[**Yes, government researchers really did invent the Internet**][9] [in response 
to a WSJ op-ed]

> 
> In truth, no private company would have been capable of developing a project 
> like the Internet, which required years of R&D efforts spread out over scores 
> of far-flung agencies, and which began to take off only after decades of investment. 
> Visionary infrastructure projects such as this are part of what has allowed 
> our economy to grow so much in the past century. Today’s op-ed is just one 
> sad indicator of how we seem to be losing our appetite for this kind of ambition.

NYT: “**[Pinterest, Tumblr and the Trouble with ‘Curation.’][10]** Sehnsucht: 
German for “addictive yearning.” That about nails it.” @CharlesHGreen

> 
> Here’s The Awl’s co-editor, Choire Sicha, for instance, on the subject of rebloggers 
> who fancy themselves curators: “As a former actual curator, of like, actual 
> art and whatnot, I think I’m fairly well positioned to say that you folks with 
> your blog and your Tumblr and your whatever are not actually engaged in a practice 
> of curation. Call it what you like: aggregating? Blogging? Choosing? Copyright 
> infringing sometimes? But it’s not actually curation, or anything like it. 
> . . .” To which a commenter added: “My Tumblr isn’t so much curated space as 
> it is a symptom of deeper pathologies made manifest.”
