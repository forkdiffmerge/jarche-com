## **Personal Knowledge Management**

The subject of PKM has been discussed a lot here so I’ve aggregated the more 
important posts in order to provide an overview and a starting point on the 
subject. **[Link to PKM][10]**

## Friday’s Finds

Every Friday I review what I’ve noted on Twitter and post a wrap-up of what 
caught my eye. I do this as a reflective thinking process and also in order 
to take some of what I’ve learned and put it on a platform I can control, my 
blog. **[Link to Friday’s Finds][11]**

**Book Reviews**

I regularly **[review books][12]** that I have read and feel are worth recommending 
to others. Writing a review forces me to reflect on what I have found is important. 
Disclosure: I use Amazon affiliate links, for which I receive a small commission 
and then use any gift certificates to subsidize the purchase of more books. 
Also, I sometimes receive free books from publishers.
