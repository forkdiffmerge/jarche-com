**Extended Bio: Harold Jarche, Chairman, Internet Time Alliance: **Harold Jarche 
helps organizations learn, work, and innovate in the network era. He has been 
described as “a keen subversive of the last century’s management and education 
models”. People have connected with Harold over the past decade, through his 
blog (jarche.com) and professional services, for innovative ideas on leadership, 
social business, and collaboration. He also distills heady topics like complexity 
theory into practical advice.

Clients appreciate Harold for his extensive experience and network. He has 
been called a big-picture game-changer and a real thought leader. His internationally 
renowned blog has been described as a beacon of light in the dark landscape 
of organizational learning. According to one long-time reader, “_Harold is 
one of the best thinkers out there on things relating to learning and work_“. 
For his clients, Harold helps to identify essential next practices for an increasingly 
complex networked world.

A graduate of the Royal Military College, Harold served over 20 years in the 
Canadian Forces in leadership and training roles. Harold began his career as 
an officer with Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry. He completed his 
service as a Training Development Officer with the Royal Canadian Air Force 
where he conducted the analysis and design of training for aircrew and support 
personnel on the CH146 helicopter.

Harold earned a Master of Education degree at the University of New Brunswick 
with a thesis on Learning in the New Brunswick Information Technology Workplace. 
After his military service, Harold held senior positions at the Centre for 
Learning Technologies at Mount Allison University and e-Com Inc. where he was 
Chief Learning Officer.

In 2003 Harold launched his independent consulting practice in Sackville, NB, 
Canada. Clients have included AstraZeneca, CIGNA, CAE, and the Canada School 
of Public Service. Harold has been a speaker at many venues, including the 
SIBOS-SWIFT International Banking Forum, the Government of Canada Assistant 
Deputy Ministers Forum, and the Conference Board of Canada.

Harold co-founded the UK-based Internet Time Alliance in 2009 with Jay Cross, 
Jane Hart, Charles Jennings and Clark Quinn. The Alliance develops strategies 
to help organizations innovate in the 21st century by improving workplace collaboration, 
adapting to a transparent and always-on world, and increasing speed of access 
to knowledge. He is a co-author of _The Working Smarter Fieldbook_ with his 
Alliance colleagues.

A guiding goal in much of Harold’s work is the democratization of the enterprise. 
Democracy is our best structure for political governance and he believes it 
should be the basis of our workplaces as well.

As work and learning become integrated in a networked society, Harold sees 
great opportunities to create better employment models. We can do better than 
cubicle farms, cookie-cutter job descriptions, generic work competencies and 
boring, dead-end jobs.

Harold’s preferred workplace is on his bicycle, where he gets his best ideas.
