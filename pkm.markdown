# Personal Knowledge Management

Network learning, or personal knowledge management (PKM), is an individual, 
disciplined process by which we make sense of information, observations and 
ideas. In the past, self-directed learning may have involved keeping a journal, 
writing letters or having conversations. These are still valid, but with digital 
media we can add context by categorizing, commenting on, or even remixing information. 
We can also store information for easy retrieval as we need it.

Network learning, at the individual level, includes:

* Personal directed learning – how individuals can use social media for their own (self-directed) personal or professional learning; and
* Accidental and serendipitous learning – how individuals, by using social media, can learn without consciously realizing it (e.g., incidental or random learning).

At its core, network learning is a way to deal with an ever-increasing amount 
of digital information. It requires an open attitude toward learning and finding 
new things. Each worker needs to develop individualized processes of filing, 
classifying and annotating information for later retrieval.

Standard document management methods have been shown to fail over the years, 
as most workers do not personally adopt them. Developing good network learning 
skills, on the other hand, can aid in observing, thinking and using information 
and knowledge. Learning in networks also prepares the mind to be open to new 
ideas and can result in “enhanced serendipity.” As Louis Pasteur said, chance 
favours the prepared mind [Steven Berlin Johnson says that chance favours the 
**connected** mind].

One way to look at network learning is as a continuous process of seeking, 
sensing and sharing.

* Seeking is finding things out and keeping up to date. Building a network of colleagues is helpful in this regard—it not only allows us to “pull” information, but also have it “pushed” to us by trusted sources.
* Sensing is how we personalize information and use it. Sensing includes reflection and putting into practice what we have learned. Often it requires experimentation, as we learn best by doing.
* Sharing includes exchanging resources, ideas and experiences with our networks and collaborating with our colleagues.

# PKM Overview

Here are four main processes that can be used in developing critical thinking 
skills using web tools (click image to enlarge).

[![][6]][7]

 

Using a Seek-Sense-Share framework (à la personal knowledge management), you 
should start by picking one or more web platforms on which to practise critical 
thinking.[![][8]][9]

||**PKM**|**Critical Thinking Process**|**Web Tools & Strategies**|
|**1)**|**SEEK**|**Observe & Study**|
**Use an aggregator (feed reader) to keep track of online conversations. ** 
**Follow interesting people on Twitter.** **Use Social Bookmarks (set them free). ****Find a Twitter App to suit your needs. ******Create online (reusable) mind maps,  graphics and text files of your thoughts. **** 
******With more information in online databases, use Search, instead of file 
folders. ************Set up automated searches. ************Review your bookmarks, Twitter favourites, etc.******
|
|**2)**|**SENSE**|
**Challenge & Evaluate;** ** ****Form Tentative Opinions**
|
**Tweet your thoughts, not just those of others.** **Write a reasoned response to an article/post that inspires/provokes you. ** 
******Write an original Blog post. ****Present your images/mindmaps with explanations****Write book/video reviews. ****Aggregate your learning from various sources and post a regular “what I learned” 
article – text, podcast, video, image**
|
|**3)**|**SHARE**|**Participate**|
**Connect via Twitter.** ** ****Share social bookmarks through groups & networks. ****Join Social Networks. ****Join in Tweet Chats. ********Comment on or about other blogs. ****Continue and extend conversations from news sources, other tweets or blog 
posts.**
|

In my opinion, the core of PKM is 2) sensing, though 1) active observation 
is necessary to feed sense-making processes and 3) sharing with others creates 
better feedback loops. The diversity of both what one seeks and who one shares 
with have a significant impact on the quality of sense-making processes.

**Notes from my [workshop on PKM][12] at the University of Toronto’s iSchool Institute**. 

# Finding the Time for PKM

A [survey of small and medium sized businesses][13] (SMB) showed workers spend 
about half their day on **unproductive tasks**:

> 
> Knowledge Workers are among the largest staff component in a typical SMB.
> 
> SMB Knowledge Workers spend an estimated 36 percent of their time trying to: 
> 
> * Contact customers, partners or colleagues
> * Find information
> * Schedule a meeting
> 
> Approximately 14 percent of SMB Knowledge Workers’ time is spent:
> 
> * Duplicating information (e.g. forwarding e-mails or phone calls to confirm if fax/e-mail/text message was received
> * Managing unwanted communications (e.g. spam e-mails or unsolicited time-wasting phone calls)
> 

[![][14]][15]

_Note: I registered for access to the complete report but it does not go into 
survey methodology or indicate the sample size, so I would not consider this 
scientific, but it’s an interesting data point._

These activities are important but obviously they take too much time. Finding 
the right information faster can be addressed individually through frameworks 
like networked learning (PKM). Finding information, plus the remaining four 
activities can be made more effective and efficient through social networks. 
For example, the largest stated benefit of organizations using social media 
is increasing speed of access to knowledge ([McKinsey 2010][16]). Simple tools 
like [Doodle][17] can make scheduling a breeze. Social networks like Twitter 
or LinkedIn let you find the right people faster.

Therefore, the ROI for social media in business is pretty obvious: **reducing 
wasted time**.

In addition, there is a huge performance benefit. Not only is there less wasted 
time but that time can go into learning.

Since +90% of our learning is [not supported by formal instruction][18], the 
opportunities for using social media at work are evident – **more time for 
personal learning as well as a medium for networked learning.**

# Sense-making

The term [personal knowledge management][21] (PKM) isn’t about management in 
a business sense but rather how we can manage to make sense of information 
and experience in our electronic surround.

Personal – according to one’s abilities, interests & motivation (not directed 
by external forces).

Knowledge – connecting information to experience (know what, know who, know 
how).

Management – getting things done.

PKM is an individually created process. Tim Kastelle has discussed how important 
it is to [Filter][22], in the process of **Aggregate-Filter-Connect**. I use **Seek-Sense-Share** 
to describe PKM.

The critical part of PKM is in personalizing information and experience, or 
to use a business term, adding value. Ross Dawson shows [five ways][23] to 
add value to information (my examples/descriptions follow):

1. 
**Filtering** (separating signal from noise, based on some criteria)
2. 
**Validation** (ensuring that information is reliable, current or supported by research)
3. 
**Synthesis** (describing patterns, trends or flows in large amounts of information)
4. 
**Presentation** (making information understandable through visualization or logical presentation)
5. 
**Customization** (describing information in context)

Terms such as _Filter_ or _Sense_ don’t adequately describe the sense-making 
process in PKM. Looking at it from an outside perspective though, as Ross Dawson 
has done, gives another way to describe some of what is happening in our minds. 
We are adding value (and context) to information so that we can later retrieve 
it and perhaps use it. Whatever we make transparent is value-added information 
for others, especially if we do it consciously and well.

The image below shows an expanded description of sense-making in the context 
of PKM.

[![][24]][24]

A basic tool I’ve described for PKM is [social bookmarking][25] to file information. 
It’s simple but doesn’t add a lot of value, just a few text comments. A tweet 
is also simple and cannot add much value with a 140 character limit. A blog 
post can be much more informative especially if one takes time to research, 
link and compose. A collaborative document that [aggregates information][26] 
and shows it from a different perspective could also be valuable. Developing 
a [slide presentation][27] with carefully selected graphics could be seen as 
higher value information. More difficult to produce and perhaps adding more 
value to basic information, could be a [narration with the slideshow][28]. 
I have noticed that the process of developing higher-value information helps 
to sharpen one’s own thinking.

**Once again, I want to point out that people with better PKM skills, an ability 
to create higher value information, and a willingness to share it, will become 
more valued members (nodes) in their professional networks.**

# Using our Knowledge

[![][29]][30]

“_Without reflection, we go blindly on our way, creating more unintended consequences, 
and failing to achieve anything useful.”_ [Margaret J. Wheatley][31].

All the information and knowledge in the world will not help us unless we take 
time to reflect upon what we have learned and also do something with it. When 
I discuss personal knowledge management [a term that really needs to be changed 
and I welcome suggestions] I emphasize reflection through doing. In my case, 
this happens most often on my blog. Blogs, and other online self-publishing 
tools, are powerful tools for reflection.

* Blogs act as the glue between our interactions with others, whether they be projects, meetings or conferences
* Blogs are ways of mapping our personal learning journey
* Every blog is unique and, over time, gives a whole-person view
* Blogs encourage dialogue and help us relate to a wider audience and be more professional
* Blogs provide peer feedback
* Blogs can also be emotional and playful, to show and share our humanity

Reflecting by writing is a start, but then we need to integrate new ways of 
thinking and doing into our lives. This is the tough part, of course. It’s 
difficult to change old habits, but I think that by posting our vision on our 
blogs we raise the stakes. We are telling the world what we stand for. We are 
setting higher expectations. And this is a good beginning: reflection, followed 
by making our thoughts explicit and public. As I mentioned in a [previous post][32], 
we’re often too busy to reflect. The discipline of writing is one way to begin 
our journey to wisdom. Then we need to act on our words.
