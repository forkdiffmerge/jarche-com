This is a good set of guidelines (via [David Hodgson][8]) and useful for conversations 
around organizational change.

**Connections:** develop an active [**PKM**][9] process, which is reviewed 
from time to time

**Open & Enquiring:** practice [**critical thinking**][10], questioning all 
**[assumptions][11]**, including your own

**Embrace uncertainty:** think of all your work as in a state of **[perpetual][12] 
[Beta][13]**

**Diversity: **“Human systems thrive on variety and diversity. ~ [**Esko Kilpi**][14]” 

**Distribute Leadership:** think of leadership as an **[emergent][15] [property][16]** 
of your networks and not a permanent position in a hierachy

**Vision: **shared vision comes through **[trusted networks][17]**, however **[a 
clear vision is necessary, but not sufficient][18]**

**Values: [transparent organizations][19]** are better at sharing values but 
**[the initial design influences everything][20]**
